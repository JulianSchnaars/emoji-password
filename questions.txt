What can you say about the password you just created?

- It was difficult for me to find a password that fitted the given requirements.
- Choosing the password was annoying.

What can you say about the way you communicate?
- My favourite way of staying in touch is...

Now a little more serious: How do you handle your personal password management?
- I have a password or set of passwords I reuse in different places.
- I have a password that you use for different accounts with a slight modification for each account.
- When choosing a password I think of a sentence or phrase to help me remember my password.
- When choosing a password I think of a picture or scene to help me remember my password.
- When choosing a password I think of a story to help me remember my password.

Please tell us how you fell about the following. Answer intuatively. There are no "wrong" or "right" answers.
- I think emoji character would make it easier to create passwords that are based on a story / an image / a pharase.
- If passwords required emoji instead of special characters, I think it would be easier for me to use and remember them.
- If my main email account required a password like the one I created in this study, it would make my email account more secure.
- I would be annoyed if my main email account required a password like the one I had to create in this study.
- If my main email account required a password like the one described in this study, it would be easier for me to remember it.
- How would you compare the act of logging in on different devices?
- I use as few special characters as possible in my password, because it is difficult to type them on mobile keyboards.

These last questions pertain to your real online identity.
- How many accounts do you have that you regularly log into? (At least once a week)
- How many of your passwords do you regularly type on mobile devices?
- How many of your accounts provide an alternative/different authentication method (e.g. a PIN) for their mobile websites/app?
- Thinking about the real password you use for your primary email account, how many of the following does it contain? Write "0" if there are none.
